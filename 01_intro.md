Scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) enable the precise quantification of structure and chemistry through the collection and analysis of elastic and inelastic scattering events. The modern electron beam reaches sub-angstrom wavelengths, a distance smaller than the bond lengths of atoms. Collecting inelastic scattering events via their energy loss, a specimen's chemical makeup can be routinely measured using either energy-dispersive X-rays (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). However, the acquisition of high-resolution chemical images often necessitates doses that may surpass the tolerance of the specimen, leading to chemical maps that are either noisy or completely absent ([Hart 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-07709-4)). Challenges in this field of high resolution chemical imaging remain prevalent despite advancements in detectors efficiency and dose shielding mechanisms like cryogenic-STEM allowing for specimen damage reductions ([McMullan 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ultramic.2014.08.002)). On the flipside, the high-angle annular dark-field detector (HAADF) collects elastically scattered electrons, offering a direct view of the atomic structure with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), but provides limited chemical information. The lack of chemical information from HAADF projections is due to the intensity of the element being proportional to roughly atomic number $Z^2$ where two elements close in atomic number are indistinguishable from one another ([LeBeau 2008](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.206101)).  Additionally, since the image taken on the microscope is a projection through the whole viewing area, differential density further complicates how to interpret different sections in the image and lead to false conclusions.

Traditionally, detector outputs like HAADF and EDX/EELS have been analyzed independently, overlooking the potential insights from integrating structure and chemical data from the two separate modalities. Unlike correlative imaging, data-fusion merges sparse signals to enhance the accuracy of both measurements ([Hall 1997](https://doi.org/10.1109/5.554205)) ([Lahat 2015](https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2460697)) ([Di 2016](https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1021404)).  Due to its power to improve image quality, the data fusion approach has seen an explosion in popularity in the past decade in the panchromatic, infrared, hyperspectral and Lidar satellite remote sensing communities ([Sun 2023](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11432-022-3588-0)). Data fusion relies on crafting a model that can capture interactions between different datasets without forcing unrelated connections leading to false conclusions  ([Calhoun 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2015.12.005)).

In this work, we walk through the steps in the model mathematically, algorithmically and through implementation in code to make this approach more accessible to the greater electron microscopy community.  We have provided a sample dataset that is accompanied by a full code tutorial, and we have provided an extensive algorithm section where every variable is explained and sequentially manipulated for full transparency. This approach has been tested extensively in the case of 2D projections utilizing EDX and EELS signals ([Schwartz 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41524-021-00692-5)). Fused Multi-Modal data fusion significantly boosts the SNR of chemical maps by 300-500% and enables a reduction in required doses by more than an order of magnitude, aligning with the original data. When looking at known synthetic materials we have consistently found accurate chemical mapping and, since we can determine relative concentrations within specimens, we also have tested stoichiometry and found <15% error with no known priors of inelastic cross sections. Through this work we hope that within minutes you can go from raw data off the microscope to accurate, publishable fused multi-modal chemical maps.
