This is Tutorial 1 of 2 where we look at an atomic resolution HAADF and EDX dataset of DyScO$_3$. The multi-modal data fusion workflow relies on Python, and requires minimal user input with <10 tunable lines. Both here and in the Mathematical Overview section we outline best practices for these adjustments.  Within a few minutes, datasets such as the one in this tutorial can be transformed into resolution enhanced chemical maps.
