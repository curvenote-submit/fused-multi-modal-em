The process works best when all chemistries in the material are mapped spectroscopically and combined with a directly interpretable elastic signal. This article bridges the gap between theory and practice by walking through each step of the fused multi-modal computational pipeline and pointing out best practices when running the code. By the end of this tutorial, anyone with inelastic and elastic 2D projection data should be able to reproducibly  reconstruct chemical maps using fused multi-modal electron microscopy.","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1},"end":{"line":10,"column":1}},"key":"ZvBmtjhyYl"}],"key":"a76GG6Nx8E"},{"type":"container","kind":"figure","identifier":"fig_abstract","label":"fig_abstract","children":[{"type":"image","url":"/Figure_abstract-1be6783da1fdecc3269576dbac584ced.png","alt":"Fused Multi-Modal atomic resolution image improvement on  DyScO_3","width":"700px","data":{"altTextIsAutoGenerated":true},"key":"uACe8FRIdK","urlSource":"./figs/Figure_abstract.png"},{"type":"caption","children":[{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"captionNumber","kind":"figure","label":"fig_abstract","identifier":"fig_abstract","html_id":"fig-abstract","enumerator":"1","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Figure ","key":"Xedydx0hRu"},{"type":"text","value":"1","key":"HWQdzk0Qn1"},{"type":"text","value":":","key":"Q360qAQoeO"}],"template":"Figure %s:","key":"JbJgBFD4VF"},{"type":"text","value":"Fused Multi-Modal atomic resolution image improvement on  DyScO","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"key":"y2A9mNio63"},{"type":"subscript","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1},"end":{"line":15,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"3","key":"pTgoEqTjcB"}],"key":"YogjTH1vgJ"}],"key":"nZUpiZ9zw4"}],"key":"cVhaISNGmp"}],"enumerator":"1","html_id":"fig-abstract","key":"kOmDKtEY0r"}],"data":{"part":"abstract"},"key":"mag89ZMtYC"},{"type":"block","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Acknowledgements","position":{"start":{"line":20,"column":1},"end":{"line":20,"column":1}},"key":"aPO30DaHnp"}],"identifier":"acknowledgements","label":"Acknowledgements","html_id":"acknowledgements","implicit":true,"key":"Q0iF0PsDSi"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We acknowledge support from Dow Chemical Company.","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1},"end":{"line":22,"column":1}},"key":"sUAzKmkj0y"}],"key":"NESvoxrdOS"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1},"end":{"line":24,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Work at the Molecular Foundry was supported by the Office of Basic Energy Sciences, of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract no.
